   <h2 class="title">Parser behavior</h2>
   <p class="para">
    Parsing and execution are now two completely separated steps, no
    execution of a files code will happen until the complete file and
    everything it requires has completely and successfully been
    parsed.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    One of the new requirements introduced with this split is that
    required and included files now have to be syntactically
    complete. You can no longer spread the different controlling parts
    of a control structure across file boundaries. That is you cannot
    start a <i class="literal">for</i> or <i class="literal">while</i> loop,
    an <i class="literal">if</i> statement or a <i class="literal">switch</i>
    block in one file and have the end of loop,
    <i class="literal">else</i>, <i class="literal">endif</i>,
    <i class="literal">case</i> or <i class="literal">break</i> statements in
    a different file.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    It is still perfectly legal to include additional code within loops
    or other control structures, only the controlling keywords and
    corresponding curly braces <i class="literal">{...}</i> have to be
    within the same compile unit (file or <a href="function.eval.html" class="function">eval()</a>ed
    string).
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    This should not harm too much as spreading code like this should be
    considered as very bad style anyway.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    Another thing no longer possible, though rarely seen in PHP 3
    code is returning values from a required file. Returning a value
    from an included file is still possible.
