    SCA for PHP makes it possible for a PHP programmer to write
    reusable components, which can be called in a variety of ways, with an
    identical interface and with a minimum of fuss. At present
    components can call each other either locally or via Web services,
    but in the future it is expected that other ways will be possible. It
    provides the programmer with a way of doing this which will look as
    natural as possible in PHP. 
   </p>
   
   <p class="para"> 
    SCA components use phpDocumentor-style (see
    http://www.phpdoc.org/) annotations to declare dependencies on
    other SCA components or Web services. The SCA for PHP runtime
    resolves these dependencies at runtime on behalf of the components,
    and thus allows the PHP programmer to focus on the business logic
    rather than on locating and obtaining references to dependencies.
   </p>
   
   <p class="para"> 
    The SCA for PHP programming model can be extended to support a
    number of service types, such as REST and Atompub. However, Web
    services (more accurately, WSDL defined, SOAP/HTTP services), are
    the only type currently specified. 
   </p>
   
   <p class="para"> 
    Components also use annotations to define the interface which
    they expose as a service. The SCA for PHP runtime will automatically
    generate WSDL from these annotations, so that an SCA component is
    easily exposed as a web service. These annotations are a natural
    extension to those provided by phpDocumentor. Deploying a Web
    service can be as simple as placing a PHP component under the document
    root of a web server. 
   </p>
   
   <p class="para"> 
    Components also use annotations to specify data structures
    (expressed using XML schema complex types) which are then handled
    using Service Data Objects (SDOs). 
   </p>
   
   <p class="para"> 
    A PHP script which is not an SCA component and which contains no
    annotations can use the services of an SCA component. A PHP script or
    component can make calls to a web service that is not an SCA component,
    but using the same system of calls or annotations to obtain a
    reference.
   </p>
   
   <p class="para"> 
    First we show a single SCA component, ConvertedStockQuote
    which illustrates many of the features of SCA for PHP. It has one
    method,
    <b>getQuote()</b>, which given a stock &quot;ticker&quot;
    obtains a price quote for that stock, converted to a given currency.
    We shall be using this example as a basis for explaining the SCA for PHP
    throughout the rest of this document.

   <p class="para"> 
    In this example, we see that an SCA component is implemented by a
    script containing a PHP class and includes
    <var class="filename">SCA.php</var>. The class contains a mixture of
    business logic and references to other components or services. In
    the illustrated
    <b>getQuote()</b> method there is only business
    logic, but it relies on the instance variables
    <var class="varname">$stock_quote</var> and
    <var class="varname">$exchange_rate</var> having been initialized.
    These refer to two other components and will be initialized by the SCA
    runtime with proxies for these two services, whenever this
    component executes. The annotations for these two services show one
    to be a local component, which will be called within the same PHP
    runtime, and one to be a remote component which will be called via a
    SOAP request. This component also exposes the
    <b>getQuote()</b> method both locally and as a web
    service, so it in turn can be called either locally or remotely.

    If you want to use SCA to consume or produce Web services then you
    need PHP 5.2.0 or later, built with the soap extension enabled. If you

    service bindings, then this version of SCA for PHP will also run with

    <h2 class="title"> Obtaining a proxy for another Service Component </h2>
    <p class="para">
     One SCA component can call the service provided by another SCA
     component. The service a component provides is made up of all of its
     public methods. SCA for PHP currently provides two ways for one
     component to call another: either locally (i.e. within the same PHP
     run-time, and on the same call stack) or remotely if the called
     component exposes a Web service binding. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="para">
     In order for one component to call another, the calling
     component needs a proxy for the called component. This proxy is
     usually provided as an instance variable in the calling component,
     though proxies can also be obtained with the SCA::getService()
     call, as we shall see later. When a component is constructed,
     proxies are constructed for any instance variable which refer to
     another component, and these proxies are &quot;injected&quot; into the
     instance variables. Proxies are always used, whether the
     component is local or remote, in order to provide identical calling
     behavior between remote and local calls (for example, local calls
     are made to always pass data by-value). The proxies know how to
     locate the required component and to pass the calls made on to them.
    </p>
    
    <p class="para">
     Instance variables which are intended to hold proxies for
     services are indicated by the two PHPDocumentor-style
     annotations, @reference and @binding. Both annotations are
     placed in the documentation section for a class instance variable,
     as shown by the code below. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="para">
     The @reference annotation before an instance variable
     indicates that that instance variable is to be initialized with a
     proxy to a component. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="para"> 
     The @binding annotation has two forms @binding.php and
     @binding.soap, and indicates that the proxy is either for a local
     component or for a Web service respectively. For both @binding.php
     and @binding.soap, the annotation gives a target URI. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="para">
     At the moment, with the annotation-based method of
     specifying dependencies, the only way to alter the intended target
     of a reference is to alter the annotation within the component.

    <p class="para">
     In our ConvertedStockQuote example, the
     <var class="varname">$exchange_rate</var> instance variable will be

     For @binding.php, the URI identifies the location of the
     script containing the implementation of the component. The
     component will be called locally. The service provided is the set of
     public methods of the component. The URI must be a simple pathname,
     either absolute or relative. The component will be loaded with the
     PHP include directive, after testing to see if it is already loaded
     with
     <a href="function.class-exists.html" class="function">class_exists()</a>. If the URI is a relative
     path, it is resolved relative to the component containing the
     annotation. Note that this is different from the normal PHP
     behaviour where scripts would be looked for along the PHP
     include_path, This is intended to provide some

     to components look and behave are the same way regardless of whether
     they are to a local or remote service, so that components are not
     sensitive to whether a call is to a local or a remote service. For
     example, the proxy for a local service takes copies of the arguments
     and passes only those copies, to ensure that calls are made to be
     pass-by-value, as they would be for a remote call. Also, the proxy
     for a remote service takes the arguments from a positional
     parameter list and ensures they are packaged properly in a SOAP
     request and converted back to a positional parameter list at the far

     Components can pass the PHP scalar types string, integer, float and

     Service Data Objects (SDOs). A later section describes how a
     component can create an SDO to pass on a local or Web service call, or
     how a component can create an SDO to return. The PHP SDO project

     same way as the targets of the @binding annotations described in the

    <p class="para"> 
     SCA for PHP can generate WSDL from the annotations within a
     service component, so that it can be easily deployed and exposed as a
     Web service. To provide SCA with the information it needs to
     generate the WSDL, it is necessary to add the annotation
     @binding.soap under the @service annotation and to specify the
     parameters and return values of the methods using the @param and
     @return annotations. These annotations will be read when WSDL is
     generated, and the order and types of the parameters determine the
     contents of the
     &lt;schema&gt; section of the WSDL. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="para"> 
     SCA for PHP always generates document/literal wrapped WSDL
     for components that are exposing a Web service. Note that this does
     not stop components from consuming Web services which are not SCA
     components and which are documented with WSDL written in a
     different style.

    <p class="para"> 
     The scalar types which can be used in the @param annotation are
     the four common PHP scalar types: boolean, integer, float and
     string. These are simply mapped to the XML schema types of the same
     name in the WSDL. The example below, which is a trivial
     implementation of the StockQuote service that the

      The SCA run-time has special processing to handle how
      positional parameter lists in the interface are converted to XML
      containing named parameters in the soap request, and then back to
      positional parameter lists again. To see why this matters,
      consider how a PHP script which used a different interface to make a
      SOAP call would need to construct the parameter list. A PHP script
      using the PHP SoapClient, for example, would need to pass the
      SoapClient a single parameter giving the values for &quot;ticker&quot; and
      &quot;currency&quot;, perhaps as an associative array. To insist that SCA
      components construct parameter lists to make Web service calls in
      this way would be to make local and remote calls look different, so a
      different approach is needed.

      When SCA generates WSDL for an SCA component it includes a
      comment in the WSDL which marks that WSDL as being the interface for
      an SCA component. In this case, when one SCA component calls
      another through a Web service, the SCA runtime on the calling end
      takes the positional parameter list from the call and assigns the
      values one by one to the named elements in the soap message. For
      example a call to the
      <b>getQuote()</b> method defined above that

       At both ends the SCA runtime relies on the order in which the
       parameters appear in the soap message being the same as that in the
       target method&#039;s parameter list. This is ultimately determined
       by the order of the @param annotations: this determines the order
       in which the parameters appear in the WSDL and thereby the order in
       which they appear in the soap message. Therefore it is essential
       that the order of the @param annotations matches that of the
       parameters in the method&#039;s parameter list.

    <h2 class="title"> Working with Data Structures </h2>
    <p class="para">
     SCA components can pass and return the four PHP scalar types
     boolean, integer, float and string, but to pass or return data
     structures, SCA components use Service Data Objects (SDOs). SDOs
     are described in much more detail in
     <a href="ref.sdo.html" class="link">the SDO pages</a> of this manual.
     Readers familiar with SDOs will know that they are suitable for
     representing the sort of structured and semi-structured data that
     is frequently modeled in XML, and that they serialize very
     naturally for passing between remote components, or in Web
     services. SDOs are presently the only supported way to pass and
     return data structures. It is not possible to pass or return PHP
     objects, or PHP arrays. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="para"> 
     The SCA runtime always assures data is passed by-value, even
     for local calls. To do this, the SCA runtime copies any SDOs in the
     parameter list before passing them on, just as it does for scalar
     types. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="section">
     <h2 class="title"> How data structures are defined to SCA components </h2>
     <p class="para"> 
      Currently the only mechanism for specifying the location of
      a data structure definition is by specifying the types in an XML
      schema file. However, in the future it may be possible to define
      types in other ways, such as based on PHP classes or interfaces, or
      based on definitions expressed as associative arrays. 
     </p>
     
     <p class="para">
      To illustrate the use of SDOs we introduce a new component.
      The PortfolioMangement service below returns an SDO

      Business exceptions may be defined and thrown by a component
      in the normal way, regardless of whether the component has been
      called locally or remotely. The SCA runtime does not catch
      business exceptions that have been thrown by a component called
      locally, so they will be returned to a caller in the normal way. If a
      component has been called via a Web service, on the other hand, the
      SCA runtime on the service providing end does catch business
      exceptions, and will ensure these are passed back to the calling
      end and re-thrown. Assuming that the calling end has a definition
      of the exception (that is, is able to include a file containing the
      PHP class defining the exception) the re-thrown exception will
      contain the same details as the original, so that the
      <b>getLine()</b> and
      <b>getFile()</b> methods for example will contain
      the location where the exception was thrown within the business
      logic. The exception will be passed in the detail field of a soap
      fault with a fault code of &quot;Client&quot;.
