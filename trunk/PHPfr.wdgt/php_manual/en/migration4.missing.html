   <h2 class="title">Missing functions</h2>
   <p class="para">
    While PHP 4 comes with a lot of new features, functions and
    extensions, you may still find some functions from version 3
    missing. A small number of core functions has vanished because
    they do not work with the new scheme of splitting parsing and
    execution as introduced into 4 with the Zend engine.  Other
    functions and even complete extensions have become obsolete as
    newer functions and extensions serve the same task better and/or
    in a more general way. Some functions just simply haven&#039;t been
    ported yet and finally some functions or extensions may be missing
    due to license conflicts.
   </p>

   <div id="migration4.missing.concept" class="section">
    <h2 class="title">Functions missing due to conceptual changes</h2>
    <p class="para">
     As PHP 4 now separates parsing from execution it is no longer
     possible to change the behavior of the parser (now embedded in
     the Zend engine) at runtime as parsing already happened by
     then. So the function <b>short_tags()</b> no longer
     exists. You can still change the parser&#039;s behavior by setting
     appropriate values in the <var class="filename">php.ini</var> file.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Another feature of PHP 3 that is not a part of PHP 4 is the bundled
     debugging interface. There are third-party add-ons for the Zend engine
     which add similar functionality.

   <div id="migration4.deprecate" class="section">
    <h2 class="title">Deprecate functions and extensions</h2>
    <p class="para">
     The Adabas and Solid database extensions are no more. Long live
     the unified ODBC extension instead.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div id="migration4.unset" class="section">
    <h2 class="title">Changed status for <a href="function.unset.html" class="function">unset()</a></h2>
    <p class="para">
     <a href="function.unset.html" class="function">unset()</a>, although still available, is
     implemented as a language construct rather than a function.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     This does not have any consequences on the behavior of
     <a href="function.unset.html" class="function">unset()</a>, but testing for &quot;unset&quot; using
     <a href="function.function-exists.html" class="function">function_exists()</a> will return <b><tt>FALSE</tt></b> as it would with
     other language constructs that look like functions such as
     <a href="function.echo.html" class="function">echo()</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Another more practical change is that it is no longer possible to
     call <a href="function.unset.html" class="function">unset()</a> indirectly, that is
     <i class="literal">$func=&quot;unset&quot;; $func($somevar)</i> won&#039;t work
     anymore.
